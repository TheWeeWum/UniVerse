## Problem domain
On a campus as large as UofT it could be difficult to find a good study spot and avoid the crowds. Thus, we want to make an application designed to provide information about the campus to help students navigate and discover new places on campus. 

## Features
1. Students can write reviews for specific buildings in University of Toronto. 
2. Students/staffs can add events to buildings (where the event is being held) with event details.
3. Students can sign up and log in to keep their account information, like favorite buildings and reviews.
4. The Main Map page shows pins of University of Toronto's buildings. Students can interact with pins to leave a review, or get redirected to a building page, where building information is displayed.
5. The buildings list page shows all the University of Toronto's buildings. Students can click on it to get redirected to the building's page.
   
## Additional features (that could be implemented in the future)
1. Community Tab: Students can post UofT related content and interact with other students
2. Adding friends: Allow users to upload their timetables and share their time tables with friends
